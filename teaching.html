<h1>Teaching Experience</h1>
<p>I have been fortunate to work as a teaching assistant (TA) several times during my undergrad and PhD. My role as a TA in the class varied a fair bit across the different classes.
</p>
<h2>UC Berkeley</h2>
<p>I worked as a Graduate Student Instructor (GSI)&#8201;&mdash;&#8201;another name for a TA who is also a graduate
student&#8201;&mdash;&#8201;for two courses at UC Berkeley <b>EECS 189:
Introduction to Machine Learning</b> in Spring 2018, and <b>STAT 154: Modern
Statistical Prediction and Machine Learning</b> in Spring 2019+. 
</p>
<p><b>EECS 189</b> (350+ students), Spring 2018:  I taught this class with the instructors Prof. Jennifer Listgarten and Prof. Anant Sahai and a team of 20 graduate and undergraduate student instructors. I was one of the head GSIs. My primary contributions were developing content for the class and ensuring smooth coordination across the content development team. Besides supervising the team's coordination, I worked on designing some new problems, touching-up some old problems, occasionally interacting with the students in teaching sections, conducting office hours, and attending homework parties. <br />
Feedback from the class is available  <a href="documents/taship/189_sec1.pdf" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>here</a>. 
</p>
<p><b>STAT 154</b> (150+ students), Spring 2019: Yuansi Chen and I were the teaching assistants for this class under the instructor Prof. Bin Yu (who was also one of my two super cool Ph.D. advisors). For this class, my role was much more involved than a usual TA. Yuansi Chen and I were the two GSIs who handled the load of 150 undergraduate students, besides a serious contribution in re-designing of the class. The two of us not only designed the bi-weekly homework, weekly discussion, and exam content from scratch, we also developed two mini-projects based on real-data to facilitate a real hands-on experience for the students. <br />
Feedbacks from the class is available here: 
<a href="documents/taship/154_class.pdf" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Entire class</a>, 
<a href="documents/taship/154_sec1.pdf" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Section 1</a> and  
<a href="documents/taship/154_sec2.pdf" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Section 2</a>.
</p>
<h2>IIT Bombay</h2>
<p>During my undergrad, I worked as an undergraduate TA for several institute level undergraduate courses. The duties for these classes included weakly teaching sections of 40-50 students and evaluating the exams. It was during these times that I realized how much I enjoyed teaching. I used to conduct several extra sessions where the attendance would often exceed 200.

<li><p><b>MA 108: Ordinary Differential Equations</b> (Spring 2012, Spring 2013)

<p>*Feedback is based on data collected by me during my first teaching experience at IIT Bombay in Fall 2011 (maintaining the anonymity of the students). There was no formal review system at IIT Bombay for TAs during my undergrad.
</p>
<p>Besides, I also worked as a teaching assistant for an <b>online course on Linear Algebra</b> with 
<a href="http://www.math.iitb.ac.in/~neela/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Prof.
Neela Nataraj</a> for <b>400+ undergraduate colleges</b>, organized by the Ministry of Human
Resource Development of the Government of India.
